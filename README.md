# The plan

idk

# todos
 - make a script to run quickly
 - reorganize the classes
 - [DONE] output the actual csvs for cov, exp etc.
 - do some simulations
 - output a latex doc instead of a bunch of random plots
 - could be cool to see the different losses and how the magnitudes change over epochs
 - better labelling on losses
